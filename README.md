# Access Control
> Provide more granular access management (pure front-end implementation)

At present, only the notebook can be locked. If the lock document is not processed, the lock document will be abnormal

## How to use
After installing the plug-in, right-click the notebook (not the document!) in the document tree. The pop-up menu will have a plug-in, and the secondary directory will have the option of 'Add password'

After adding the password, left-click on the locked notebook and a dialog box will pop up

After unlocking, the right-click directory will become 'unencrypt' and 'Lock notebook', so you need to lock the notebook manually

⚠️ Note: Currently you can only lock your laptop! Locking the notebook does not automatically close open documents!

## Development plan
Perfect plug-in
